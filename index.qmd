I'm a researcher using modelling methods to support decision making in public health and conservation science.

- My research is around modelling mosquito distributions to inform malaria control with the [Vector Atlas](https://vectoratlas.icipe.org){target="_blank"}, as well as other problems in infectious diseases.
- I have expertise in:
  - population dynamics of wildlife and infectious diseases
  - species distribution modelling and dynamics
  - risk assessment
- I work at the [Infectious Disease Ecology and Modelling](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/child-health-analytics-research-program/infectious-disease-ecology-and-modelling/){target="_blank"} team the Telethon Kids Institute
- I sit with with the [Infectious Disease Dynamics Unit](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/centre-for-epidemiology-and-biostatistics-research/Infectious-Disease-Dynamics){target="_blank"} at the Melbourne School of Global and Population Health, University of Melbourne
